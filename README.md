# Shows Subscription Android App

First version of the shows application created natively in android, then it was replaced by one developed using the dart language, and the flutter framework. The idea of this application was to create a means by which the user would be able to subscribe to the show (plays) you want and then receive messages, parts of videos, audios, continuing with the chosen story, within a period of days. For this a chat window would be used, eventually the user could influence the story by making decisions and changing the course of the messages received.
